Machine learning represents a branch of artificial intelligence that concentrates on creating algorithms and statistical models that allow computer systems to enhance their performance on a particular task through experience. Unlike conventional programming, where clear instructions are given, machine learning systems learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions based on that learning.

The field has experienced significant growth in recent years, with applications ranging from image recognition and natural language processing to recommendation systems and autonomous vehicles. Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, uses neural networks with multiple layers to model and understand complex patterns in data.
