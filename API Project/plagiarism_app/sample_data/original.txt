Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computer systems to improve their performance on a specific task through experience. Unlike traditional programming, where explicit instructions are provided, machine learning systems learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions based on that learning.

The field has seen tremendous growth in recent years, with applications ranging from image recognition and natural language processing to recommendation systems and autonomous vehicles. Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, uses neural networks with multiple layers to model and understand complex patterns in data.
