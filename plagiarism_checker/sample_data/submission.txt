Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models. It involves training models on data to make predictions without being explicitly programmed.

Deep learning uses neural networks with multiple layers to learn complex patterns. These networks are inspired by the human brain, with interconnected nodes that process information.

Natural language processing (NLP) is an important area of AI that deals with the interaction between computers and human language. It enables machines to understand and generate human language.
