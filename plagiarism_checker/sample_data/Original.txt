Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computer systems to improve their performance on a specific task through experience. It involves training models on data to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for every scenario.

Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, uses neural networks with multiple layers to learn complex patterns in data. These networks are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, with interconnected nodes that process information.

Natural language processing (NLP) is another important area of AI that deals with the interaction between computers and human language. It enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a valuable way.
